# Verify Setup

At this point, we have:
* Two prometheus instances configured to `remote_write`.
* `Thanos Receive` component ingesting data from Prometheus
* `Thanos Query` component configured to query `Thanos Receive`'s Store API.

The final task on our list is to verify that data is flowing correctly.

Stop and think how you could do this before opening the answer below ðŸ‘‡

 <summary>How are we going to check that the components are wired up correctly?</summary>

Let's make sure that we can query data from each of our Prometheus instances from our `Thanos Query` instance.

Navigate to the [Thanos Query UI]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_39090}}), and query for a metric like `up` - inspect the output and you should see `batcave` and `batcomputer` in the `cluster` label.
